# RPC Solana Ok or Not ok
RPC check on the Solana blockchain

In this example, the RpcClient connection and the blockhash retrieval are performed in a more structured manner, using the match statement. This allows for error handling, so that the program can gracefully handle any potential issues that may arise while connecting to the Solana RPC or retrieving the blockhash. The code prints an error message and returns early if either operation fails.
